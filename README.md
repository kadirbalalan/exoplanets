The objectives of this analysis are as follows:

To understand exoplanets.

To make a quick analysis in order to grasp the nature of the data set.

To become familiar with the data so as to facilitate further analysis efforts.

Information about the dataset: 
The NASA Exoplanet Archive is a database that contains information on all known exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) discovered by NASA's various space missions, ground-based observatories, and other sources. The dataset includes information such as the planet's name, mass, radius, distance from its host star, orbital period, and other physical characteristics. The dataset also includes information on the host star, such as its name, mass, and radius. The archive is updated regularly as new exoplanets are discovered, and it is a valuable resource for astronomers studying the properties and distribution of exoplanets in our galaxy.
